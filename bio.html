      Hello! I am a Software Engineering student at the University of Arizona. I am interested in developing and using artificial intelligence. I am 26 years old and enjoy working with computers and building useful products for people. In my free time, I love to spend time with my cats and reptiles, crochet fun patterns, and have recently gotten into baking and cooking! Welcome to my website!
